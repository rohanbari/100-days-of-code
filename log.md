# #100DaysOfCode Log

### Day 0: February 1, 2021 (not counted)

**Today's Progress:** Participated the `#100DaysOfCode` challenge and configured my
[repository](https://github.com/rohanbari/100DaysOfCode).

**Thoughts:** I'm feeling quite optimistic after registering into this challenge.

### Day 1: February 1, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Learned about stacks and heaps, and developed a program to demonstrate
how to find differences between them by just viewing their declaration style.

**Thoughts:** I had always some kind of confusion between stacks and heaps. It's my first day in
#100DaysOfCode, feeling pride in myself! I'm curious for the future.

### Day 2: February 2, 2021

**Today's Progress:**

  1. Learned about various types of overflows, identifying their possible occurences and how to prevent them.
  2. I made an efficient and feasible program that measures the usage of each alphabetical letter, alongside its
  overall usage percentage.

**Thoughts:** Still, I'm feeling alike an efficient programmer. But, more curious to explore C in depth than ever.
Debugging in mind without using an actual debugger has become easier for me.

### Day 3: February 3, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Understood about `va_start()`, `va_list()`, `va_end()`, i.e. passing variable number of
arguments to a function/subroutine and utilize them efficiently. Coded a program to demonstrate this further effectively.

**Thoughts:** My technical tone while speaking has become a bit more perfect. I'm just pride of myself.

### Day 4: February 4, 2021

**Today's Progress:**

  1. Demonstrated the benefits of using structs, especially when multiple fields need to be passed into a single argument.
  In the same way, multiple structs can be passed into a single argument via pointers, like an array but reallocate-ably by
  developing a simple robust-coded calculator program.
  
  2. Developed a program to illustrate the usage of two-dimensional array as a simple mathematical matrix.

**Thoughts:** Feeling like more dedicated than previous days and encouraged a lot to learn.

### Day 5: February 5, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Created a program that summarizes and illustrates the most efficient methods of initializing the `char*` strings.

**Thoughts:** Started to pretend and think like an ideal programmer.

  * [Various valid methods of initializing strings](https://github.com/rohanbari/100DaysOfCode/blob/master/src/005/valid_string_init.c)

### Day 6: February 6, 2021

**Today's Progress:**

  1. Developed a program that iterates till the end of the `char *[]` and verifies conveniently if every initial character
  in each string are equal.
  
  2. Coded a program to illustrate the practical application of various built-in mathematical methods.

**Thoughts:** Equivalent feeling like that of DAY2 and DAY4 combined.

### Day 7: February 7, 2021

**Today's Progress:** I was really having trouble understanding the concept of multidimensional arrays. So, I
learned its concepts and signified its overflow possibilities by experimenting with its sizes and the indirectly
describing its capability to reduce the program complexity.

**Thoughts:** Not feeling like yesterday, but I'm neutral. I had pretty much lack of time for coding today.

### Day 8: February 8, 2021

**Today's Progress:** I've created a program that can be used to demonstrate the symptoms of a recursive function,
and their implementation in the code.

**Thoughts:** I'm not feeling lesser than a standard programmer. Being ideal is like everything to me at this
moment. I usually stay optimistic these days.

### Day 9: February 9, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Designed an ideal text-mode editor that is based on the usage of program arguments
to increase efficiency and understandability of code.

**Thoughts:** I missed yesterday, but... the 9th day's still in count because I haven't slept yet. It's 12:26 AM,
February 10th, I was busy a lot today. Anyway, I'm experiencing through professionalism now!

### Day 10: February 10, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Still learning the essentials of Data Structures and Algorithms. Completed the development
of Employee Management System's v0.1 release.

**Thoughts:** Neutral.
