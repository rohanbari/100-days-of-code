# #100DaysOfCode Log

### Day 0: February 1, 2020 (not counted)

**Today's Progress:** Participated the `#100DaysOfCode` challenge and configured my
[repository](https://github.com/rohanbari/100DaysOfCode).

**Thoughts:** I'm feeling quite optimistic after registering into this challenge.

### Day 1: February 1, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Learned about stacks and heaps, and developed a program to demonstrate
how to find differences between them by just viewing their declaration style.

**Thoughts:** I had always some kind of confusion between stacks and heaps. It's my first day in
#100DaysOfCode, feeling pride in myself! I'm curious for the future.

### Day 2: February 2, 2020

**Today's Progress:**

  1. Learned about various types of overflows, identifying their possible occurences and how to prevent them.
  2. I made an efficient and feasible program that measures the usage of each alphabetical letter, alongside its
  overall usage percentage.

**Thoughts:** Still, I'm feeling alike an efficient programmer. But, more curious to explore C in depth than ever.
Debugging in mind without using an actual debugger has become easier for me.

### Day 3: February 3, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Understood about `va_start()`, `va_list()`, `va_end()`, i.e. passing variable number of
arguments to a function/subroutine and utilize them efficiently. Coded a program to demonstrate this further effectively.

**Thoughts:** My technical tone while speaking has become a bit more perfect. I'm just pride of myself.

### Day 4: February 4, 2020

**Today's Progress:**

  1. Demonstrated the benefits of using structs, especially when multiple fields need to be passed into a single argument.
  In the same way, multiple structs can be passed into a single argument via pointers, like an array but reallocate-ably by
  developing a simple robust-coded calculator program.
  
  2. Developed a program to illustrate the usage of two-dimensional array as a simple mathematical matrix.

**Thoughts:** Feeling like more dedicated than previous days and encouraged a lot to learn.

### Day 5: February 5, 2020

**Today's Progress:**

  1. Created a program that summarizes and illustrates the most efficient methods of initializing the `char*` strings.

**Thoughts:** Started to pretend and think like an ideal programmer.

  * [Various valid methods of initializing strings](https://github.com/rohanbari/100DaysOfCode/blob/master/src/005/valid_string_init.c)
