### Day 1: February 1, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Learned about stacks and heaps, and developed a program to demonstrate
how to find differences between them by just viewing their declaration style.

**Thoughts:** I had always some kind of confusion between stacks and heaps. It's my first day in
#100DaysOfCode, feeling pride in myself! I'm curious for the future.

### Day 2: February 2, 2020

**Today's Progress:**

  1. Learned about various types of overflows, identifying their possible occurences and how to prevent them.

**Thoughts:** Still, I'm feeling alike an efficient programmer. But, more curious to explore C in depth than ever.
